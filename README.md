# MikeFactorial.XTB.Plugins.PACUI
This project is an XrmToolBox Plugin that provides a User Interface over top of the Power Platform CLI for ease of connecting, exploring and executing PAC commands.

It's intended for users who may not be familiar or comfortable with working from the command line and want to use the ever-growing number of features available for the Power Platform CLI. It also  provides easy navigation and discovery for users of the command line features.
